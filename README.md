# WebDevSampler Challenge

[![Continuous Integration](https://github.com/arnaudmorisset/web-dev-sampler-rust/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/arnaudmorisset/web-dev-sampler-rust/actions/workflows/ci.yaml)

This repository contains my own take on the [WebDevSampler challenge](https://dev.to/andyhaskell/introducing-the-webdevsampler-challenge-answers-in-go-5cmh), proposed by [&y H. Golang](https://twitter.com/AndyHaskell2013).

I find this kind of exercice to be quite interesting to learn new languages, libraries, frameworks and so on.
