# WebDevSampler Challenge

## Description

> **tl:dr**: This is an exercise to hone my skills in backend web development using Rust.

This repository contains my own take on the [WebDevSampler challenge](https://dev.to/andyhaskell/introducing-the-webdevsampler-challenge-answers-in-go-5cmh), proposed by [&y H. Golang](https://twitter.com/AndyHaskell2013).

I find this kind of exercice quite interesting to learn new languages, libraries, frameworks and so on. ðŸ™‚
